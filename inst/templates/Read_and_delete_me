* Edit the help file skeletons in 'man', possibly combining help files
  for multiple functions.
* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Put any C/C++/Fortran code in 'src'.
* If you have compiled code, add a useDynLib() directive to
  'NAMESPACE'.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Read "Writing R Extensions" for more information.

--- Additional TMB-specific notes ---

* @@use_Rcpp@@Added dummy file 'src/init.cpp' to avoid problems with empty 'src'.
  You may delete this file once any C/C++ source files are added to the package.
  
* '@@usedl_pkg@@' _must_ preceed
  '@@usedl_tmb@@' in 'NAMESPACE' file.
  
  With 'roxygen2' this is achieved with:

  @rawNamespace @@usedl_pkg@@; @@usedl_tmb@@
